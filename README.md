## Problem

Some people inhibit themselves from complaining about the government-related issues fearing retribution
from public servants and other muscle forces. Although it is much easier to anonymize the people on online
forums, it can easily turn into nightmare by miscreants who use the platform to bully other users/reports.
We plan to build a platform where people can openly report/comment on ongoing issues in a pseudonymous
manner without fearing retribution yet participate responsibly by KYC-ing themselves using a wallet. The
platform could also democratically decide whether to reveal or hide the KYC from L&O departments in case of
malicious activities, without giving complete control to the government.

## Solution

We planned to develop a governance app to raise issues and welcome fellow residents grouped by their PIN Codes to vote on the changes. We identify each user/resident with a MOI ID, a ZK-proofed KYC-ed wallet provisioned by 10M3. This way, users can sign up to a new wallet, KYC themselves, and join the public community through 10M3 wallet. Using this ZK-proofed and KYC-ed wallet, users can propose changes and vote on changes in a pseudonymous way, yet giving assurance to the government that they are actual residents without revealing their Identity publicly.
